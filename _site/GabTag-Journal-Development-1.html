  <time datetime="2019-05-15T00:00:00+02:00" class="by-line">15 May 2019</time>
  <p>Here, I would like to present my experience making my first Linux Gtk application. I will mostly talk about the issues i encountered because it is the most interesseting part and the most informative too.</p>

<h2 id="issues-encontered">Issues encontered</h2>

<h3 id="first-issue-setting-up-travis-ci">First issue : Setting up Travis-ci</h3>

<p>I think the hardest thing for me has been to set up Travis-ci, I first set up a Travis-org CI (a deprecated version of Travsi) instead of the classic Travis-ci and I was not able to transfer my project in the right version of travis. I had to create a new GitHub repository to fix that. Then when it was done, I had to guess that Travis need the python3-gi package and the PygObjext pip package to be able to test the project. It was hard to guess because I first tried to install all dependency using only apt and then only using pip but I needed to install those with both.</p>

<h3 id="second-issue-make-a--grid-scrollable">Second issue : make a  grid scrollable </h3>

<p>The second i encountered was the layout, to make my grid layout scrollable, i had to put it inside a GtkAspectFrame and a GtkViewport which are not the easiest objects to access with glade. Anyway my layout is still not completely satisfying because i always need to resize the size of my panel when i’m using Gabtag.</p>

<h3 id="third-issue--using-gdkpixbuf">Third issue : Using GdkPixbuf</h3>

<p>Finally the third issue which is still not fixed is with gdkpixbuf class. It is a bit surprising how printing an image can be hard in gtk. I had to use an external API called Pillow to show a byte image. </p>

<p>Even more surprising, for some image, the gtk pixbuf is not showing a scaled version of it but a strange bruited image. This issue is only apparing on my application so I hope I will be able to quickly fix it. </p>

<h3 id="conclusion-">Conclusion :</h3>

<p>If you get a solution for those issues, you can send my an email to ismael.lachheb@protonmail.com. Otherwise, i hope my experience can help you.</p>
